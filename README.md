F1 Race Winner Prediction Model
📖 Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the winner of Formula 1 races based on historical race data. By analyzing factors such as driver, constructor, grid position, race year, round, circuit, and weather conditions, the model forecasts the likelihood of a driver winning a race.

⚙️ Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and merges datasets to create a comprehensive feature set.

Feature Engineering: Encodes categorical variables and generates synthetic features.

Model Training: Employs a Random Forest Classifier to learn from historical data.

User Input Interface: Allows users to input race details and receive predictions.

Weather Simulation: Assigns random weather conditions to races for enhanced realism.​
